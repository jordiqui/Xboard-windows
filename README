What is XBoard?
===============
XBoard is a graphical chessboard for the X Window System.  It can
serve as a user interface for chess engines such as Fairy-Max,
Crafty or GNU Chess, for the Internet Chess Server, or for electronic
mail correspondence chess. It supports all major forms of chess, such
as international chess, xiangqi and shogi. XBoard can also be used by
itself as viewer for stored chess games.  See the manual page for
further details.

XBoard is free software, copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation
and released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).  See the file
COPYING for details.

You can build xboard on most systems with the following commands.

	./configure
	make

See the file INSTALL for more detailed instructions.

See the file FAQ.html for answers to frequently asked questions.


What is WinBoard?
=================
WinBoard is a port of XBoard to run natively on Windows.  It is part
of the XBoard project and is released under the same terms as XBoard.

You can build WinBoard using any of the following toolchains.

* **MinGW-w64 (recommended):** Works both on Windows through MSYS2 and
  for cross-compiling from Linux. In an MSYS2 MinGW64 shell install the
  toolchain and helper utilities, then build from the `winboard`
  directory:

        pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-{gcc,make,flex}
        cd winboard
        make -f makefile.gcc USE_MINGW64=1

  **Pasos detallados en Windows (MSYS2 MinGW64):** si parte de un árbol
  clonado en `C:\\tools\\msys64\\home\\Administrador\\Xboard-windows-master`,
  puede seguir esta secuencia dentro de la terminal *MSYS2 MinGW64*:

  1. Actualice los paquetes base y el toolchain recomendado:

         pacman -Syu --noconfirm
         pacman -S --needed --noconfirm base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-{gcc,make,flex}

  2. Cambie al directorio del proyecto y luego al subdirectorio de
     WinBoard:

         cd /c/tools/msys64/home/Administrador/Xboard-windows-master
         cd winboard

  3. Compile con el makefile para MinGW-w64 (use `-j` si desea paralelizar):

         make -f makefile.gcc USE_MINGW64=1

  4. (Opcional) Instale los binarios resultantes en el prefijo estándar
     del entorno MinGW-w64:

         make -f makefile.gcc USE_MINGW64=1 install

  5. Ejecute `winboard.exe` desde `winboard/` o desde el destino de
     instalación para verificar que la compilación fue exitosa.

  If you are cross-compiling from a Linux host, install a MinGW-w64
  cross toolchain (for example `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc`) and prepend the
  appropriate prefix when invoking make:

        cd winboard
        make -f makefile.gcc USE_MINGW64=1 CROSS_PREFIX=x86_64-w64-mingw32-

* **Cygwin (legacy):**

        cd winboard
        make -f makefile.gcc

* **Microsoft Visual C:** Either run the commands below or open the
  project in Visual Studio and click the build button.

        cd winboard
        nmake -f makefile.ms


Reporting problems
==================

Report bugs and problems with XBoard and WinBoard to
<bug-xboard@gnu.org>.  With XBoard, please use the "script" program
to start a typescript, run XBoard with the -debug command line option,
and include the typescript output in your message.  With WinBoard,
please use the /debug command line option and include the contents of
the file WinBoard.debug.  Also tell us what kind of machine and what
operating system version you are using.  On Unix, the command "uname
-a" will tell you this.  On Windows, right-click on My Computer and
select Properties.

Here is a sample of approximately what you should type (on Unix):

    script
    uname -a
    ./configure
    make
    ./xboard -debug
    exit
    mail bug-xboard@gnu.org
    Subject: Your short description of the problem
    Your detailed description of the problem
    ~r typescript
    .

If you improve XBoard, please send a message about your changes, and
we will get in touch with you about merging them in to the main line
of development.
